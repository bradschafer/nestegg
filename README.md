# Welcome to Nest Egg

## Intro

Nest Egg is a Docker centric curated platform for modern micro-service based organizations. It is a fairly large set of technologies. As such we've tried to make getting started with a working example as simple as possible.



```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
