# Why Nest Egg

On boarding developers into larger organizations is hard. Getting developers able to commit their work and getting it systematically to production is even harder. 

Licensing can be very expensive for startups, even more so for growing businesses and enterprises. However, open source software also has many hidden costs as well as support concerns for directors and  C-level personnel .

Nest Egg is an attempt to create a base set of technologies that are open source, well supported, easily integrated and very scalable that conform to modern patterns of software organizations.  

It is our hope that by providing a base set of leading open source technologies that are integrated out-of-the-box developers, designers, architects and managers will be able collaborate around a smaller set of core technologies. These key architectural component accommodate a wide range of business needs, have large talent pools of various levels of expertise and fit nicely into startups or enterprises that are looking to migrate key business processes into modern architectural patterns.

Take a look at the key technologies in the Nest Egg stack. You might not know all of them, and you might prefer a different technology for one reason or another, but that is ok. Swap out one of the parts for another, introduce a better solution to the community. Most important, contribute any way you can. If you are knowledgeable an any of the technologies use here in the Nest Egg project join our Slack channel and help out. I am confident when you need help on another piece of the puzzle the community will be there to help you. By focusing on a small core set of capable open source technologies, we can all help each other succeed.

To Your Success,

Brad Schafer
