# Overview

## Containers

The de-facto technology of the modern infrastructure. "Manage cattle not pets" is the motto to represent the ethereal nature of continuously bringing up, deploying and bringing down automated, immutable images of needed services.  
  
**Core Technology :** [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/)  
**Learn it:**  [**Udemy - Docker Mastery**](https://www.udemy.com/docker-mastery/)  
**Use It:**  [**Getting Started**](../gettingstarted.md)\*\*\*\*

## Persistance

Persistence of data is the lifeblood of the modern business -- as a by product it's also how the data is stored, retrieved, re-shaped, and made 'available' in world where the services accessing 'data' change on a moments notice and scale up, down and sideways \( around the world \) continually.

## Search

Querying data is as important as the ability to store and retrieve it. That is why search technologies are a key technology across the business spectrum. More recently visualization of searches have become the baseline need of knowledge workers throughout the organization. One family of search technologies stands out as a clear leader. Affectionately known as the ELK Stack it fulfills its role in the search space.   
  
**Core Technology :** **ELK Stack** [**\( Elastic Search, Logstash & Kibana\)** ](https://www.elastic.co/)  
**Learn it:**    
**Use It:**  [**Getting Started**](../gettingstarted.md) 

## Messaging

Nearly every higher living organism has a nervous system. That system sends needed information all over the organism. Modern message queue servers provide much the same benefit while also adding to robustness, scale, and perhaps most important de-coupled business processes that can grow and change  though message subscriptions and publishing.  
  
**Core Technology :** [**RabbitMQ**](http://www.rabbitmq.com/)  
**Learn it:**  [**Tutorials**](http://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html)
