Sixteen years years ago today Shawn Walker released the iBuySpy workshop, later to be renamed as Dotnetnuke (DNN). The most successful open source CMS ever released on the Microsoft platform DNN became a catalyst for Microsoft to participate in the OSS world. 

Today in a nod of appreciation to Shawn and the entire community of open source developers out there, I am releasing NestEgg. 

Nest Egg is a Docker centric curated platform for modern micro-service based organizations. It is a fairly large set of technologies. As such we've tried to make getting started with a working example as simple as possible.
