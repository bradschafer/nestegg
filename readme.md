Sixteen years years ago today (Dec. 24th) Shawn Walker released the iBuySpy workshop, later to be renamed as Dotnetnuke (DNN). DNN went on to become the most successful open source CMS ever released on the Microsoft platform. Arguably DNN was a major catalyst to spur Microsoft to participate in the OSS world. 

Today in a nod of appreciation to Shawn and the entire community of open source developers out there, I am releasing NestEgg. 

Nest Egg is a Docker centric curated platform for modern micro-service based organizations. 

The goal of NestEgg is to allow anyone to setup and get started developing an enterprise grade infrastructure of open source components, hand picked to work well together.

It is a fairly large set of technologies. 

As such we've tried to make getting started with a working example as simple as possible.
